A MARMOTTE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> dear little friends, you have, I dare say, never
before heard of a Marmotte writing its history; I
know it is great boldness on my part, but I undertake
it in the hope of amusing you, and perhaps procuring
a few shillings for the poor starving Irish, who so
much need your kind and generous compassion.</p>

<p>The first recollection I have of myself, was my lying
curled up like a little ball, with two or three brothers
and sisters, in a nook in one of the rugged Alps, near
the pretty village of Courmayeur, situated in the
valley of Aosta, in Switzerland. This valley extends
from the pass of St. Martin, near the frontiers of
Yoree, to St. Bernard; it is very fertile, and abounds
in pastures and all sorts of fruit.</p>

<p>One day, when about six weeks old, contrary to the
express commands of my parents, I quitted the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
crevice where we lived, and wandered to a short distance,
to amuse myself by jumping from rock to rock;
when, Oh! fatal effect of disobedience! I was perceived
by a little boy, who, uttering a cry of delight,
threw down the crystals he had been gathering, and
seized me by the hind legs, before I could succeed in
scrambling back to my hiding place. Conceive my
horror&mdash;my despair, at this unexpected and frightful
event. To revenge my capture, I bit the little boy&#8217;s
fingers most severely, but he only held me still tighter:
this was the fruit of my disobedience, which I have
since so often regretted. I hope my little readers
never do any thing they are bid not; for, as I have
felt, naughtiness is always punished sooner or later.</p>

<p>But to continue my history, this little boy carried
me down with him into the valley. How astonished
I was when the first emotion of fear had a little subsided,
to see all the strange objects which presented
themselves to my view in this new world; for so this
valley then appeared to me, who had never before
seen a human being, and knew only of them from the
terrible accounts our father and mother sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
gave us, on their return from excursions in search of
food. I had, therefore, rather an unpleasant opinion
of my new acquaintance; but this soon wore off, for
he treated me very kindly, and I discovered that the
horrible stories I had heard of men&#8217;s eating us alive,
were untrue, or at least greatly exaggerated; for I fear
they do sometimes kill us for food, but only in times
of great distress, when they can procure nothing else.</p>

<p>On arriving at the cottage of little Jos&eacute;, (for that
was his name) he shewed me to his mother, with
whom he lived, praising my beauty, and exulting in
the fortunate acquisition he had made.</p>

<p>My little friends, as you may not perhaps all have
seen a Marmotte, I will describe myself in a few
words, begging you at the same time to look at my
picture on the first page, for it was taken by a very
celebrated artist, and was said at the time to be a
striking likeness.</p>

<p>My head something resembles that of a hare, only
the top of it is larger and flatter, and my ears much
smaller; so small, that they are scarcely perceptible,
though the hair on that part of my head is very short.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
I have a large bushy pair of whiskers. My eyes,
which are bright and sparkling, are placed at the
side of my head, like those of a hare. The form of
my body is between that of a bear and a rat, but
much smaller than the former, and a good deal larger
than the latter. My coat is generally of a sandy
black, or red brown colour. My voice sounds much
like that of a little dog, when pleased, but our species
is remarkable for the shrill and piercing whistle
which we employ when irritated.</p>

<p>I think I have now given you a pretty accurate
description of myself, and I fear many of my little
readers will feel inclined to say, that little Jos&eacute; was
clever to find any beauty in me.</p>

<p>The old dame received me very kindly, but told
her son he would not be able to keep me long, as
Marmottes were most mischievous little animals.
This I thought very ill-natured of her, and naughtily
determined to revenge myself, by gnawing whatever
came in my way; but she afterwards treated me so
kindly, that I am happy to say I soon gave up this
wicked intention: had I continued in it, I am very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
sure that nothing but mortifications and misfortunes
would have happened to me, and I should have well
deserved them.</p>

<p>Little Jos&eacute;, thinking I must be hungry, gave me a
great piece of bread. I had never before seen any of
this sort of food, which, on tasting, I found so good
that I soon finished it all, to the evident delight of my
kind little Master; who having put some nice fresh
grass in one corner of the room, laid me upon it; and
being greatly overcome by the fatigues and anxieties
of the day, I was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>On awaking next morning, I discovered many
strange and wonderful things, which the fatigue and
fright of the preceding evening had hindered me from
observing. Among others, a very large pot on the
fire, black and ugly, which they called a Marmite,
though I can assure you it was not at all like me,
but they gave me the name of Pierrot, for, on hearing
them talk of Marmite, I once or twice answered,
thinking they meant me. I soon became very much
attached to my little master, who treated me with the
greatest kindness, sharing with me his bread and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
milk; in return for which, I amused him by my
gambols and mischievous pranks: he soon taught me
to jump over a stick, to make a bow, to dance, and
several other little tricks. When he went up the
mountains, on which occasions I was left at home
with the old dame, his mother, I laid very quietly
all day in one corner of the kitchen chimney; but
when evening approached, I climbed up a wall,
which he always passed, there to await his arrival,
and when I saw him, uttering a cry of delight, I
used to jump on his shoulder, and, purring with
pleasure, ride home in this manner. I was allowed
to wander about wherever I chose, for being very
content and happy in my new abode, I had no
wish to leave it, and did not, I fear, much desire to
return to my parents, whose dull and monotonous
way of living I could never have borne, after the
gaiety and attentions I enjoyed in the valley; for,
though I say it myself, little Jos&eacute; was the envy of all
the village for having so nice an animal as his little
Pierrot; and many were the caresses and endearing
epithets I received from all the little villagers; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
my young master always declared he would never
part with me, and he kept his word most faithfully;
for though two English travellers, wishing to have
me, offered him a large sum of money, (I believe
a guinea) if he would sell me; he resolutely refused,
although the money would have been very acceptable,
for he and his mother were both very poor. This
scene, of which I was myself a witness, greatly increased
my attachment to him, and I passed three of
the happiest months of my life under this hospitable
roof; but, alas! I was not allowed to go through life
without misfortunes any more than my neighbours,
for one evening, on little Jos&eacute;&#8217;s returning with me
after having been absent all day, the old dame, to
our great horror and dismay, said that her sister
Marie had called to beg Jos&eacute; would give his Marmotte
to her little son Simon, who was very ill, as she
thought it would amuse him.</p>

<p>My dear little friends, I cannot find words strong
enough to express my wretchedness&mdash;my despair at
this agonizing event. I jumped into the arms of my
little Master on his turning a wistful look towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
me, and burying my face in his neck, I wept most
bitterly, and, overcome by my feelings, (for though a
Marmotte, I can assure you my feelings are quite
as deep as your own) soon fell fast asleep on Jos&eacute;&#8217;s
laying me on the ground in the chimney corner, saying,
&#8220;Poor little thing! It looks as if it knew what
we were saying.&#8221; I was awoke early the next
morning by the old dame, who, having placed me in
a nice wicker basket, covered me over with a clean
cloth, carried me away without my again seeing my
little Master, who, I doubt not, had refused to part
with me. I can assure you my thoughts on this
short journey were far from enviable; to be thus
carried away from my dear little Jos&eacute; and given to a
stranger, who knew nothing about me, and who
might perhaps treat me very cruelly.</p>

<p>Simon Pacchard was a poor sickly boy, the
youngest of a large family, his mother&#8217;s pet, and consequently
a spoiled child; he was delighted to have
me, and almost smothered me with his caresses, but I
was not at all reconciled to my change of master.
The whole appearance of Marie Pacchard&#8217;s cottage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
was very different from that which I had just quitted;
it wanted that air of neatness and cleanliness which
is so charming in a cottage, as well as in a palace.
Time did not at all reconcile me to it, and every day
which I passed in my new habitation only served to
render it more disagreeable: the children teased me,
and often, after Simon had recovered sufficiently to
accompany his mother when she went to work in the
fields, I was left all day shut up in a dismally dark
room, without any thing to eat.</p>

<p>My novelty no longer pleasing my master, he soon
sought to amuse himself by tormenting me, and treating
me very cruelly. I am sure if spoiled children
knew how disagreeable they make themselves by behaving
naughtily, and how it makes them disliked,
they would never give way to their ill tempers, or
peevish whims. Having one day found, by chance,
his mother&#8217;s scissors, he caught hold of me, before I
was aware of his intention, and cut off all my bushy
whiskers, at the very great risk of putting out my
eyes; for not at all liking this treatment, I struggled
most violently, and, enraged at his cruelty, I turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
suddenly round and bit his finger severely; this
putting him into a great passion, he kicked and beat
me until I fell exhausted and half dead on the floor.</p>

<p>It was several days before I recovered the effects
of this inhuman conduct, for I was very much bruised,
and so stiff and sore, I could not move; when, however,
I was able to walk, I determined on quitting
my miserable abode, and trying to find my way back
to my dear Jos&eacute;, who I was sure would be delighted
to see me again. Accordingly, being an excellent
climber, one morning when all the family had gone
out, and left me as usual, shut up, I contrived to
climb upon the window, which had been left open by
chance: a very few moments sufficed me to descend
the side of the wall, and when I once more found
myself at liberty in the middle of the street, I recovered
my spirits, and though it was very frightful to
be all alone, I was still much happier than when in
the power of wicked Simon.</p>

<p>I much wondered that my dear little friend Jos&eacute;
had never been to see me since we parted, but hoping
for the best, I took the road I had so often before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
traversed on his shoulder, and found myself, after
numerous frights and escapes, at the door of my old
home. Think how distressed I was, when on entering,
I perceived my dear little friend seated by the
fire side, looking very pale, and so changed since I
had last seen him! Uttering a cry of agony, I jumped
into his arms. He was greatly surprised, and
exclaimed, while he tenderly caressed me with
his emaciated hand, &#8220;My poor, poor Pierrot! you
are as much changed as I am. What can have happened?&#8221;
added he on observing my bruises which
were not yet quite recovered, &#8220;The wicked little
Simon! can he have done this? Mother, mother,&#8221;
cried he, as the old dame entered the room, &#8220;look!
here is poor Pierrot returned all beaten and bruised,
I am sure he has been very ill treated.&#8221;</p>

<p>I soon learned from the conversation of little Jos&eacute;
and his mother, that his present illness had been
caused by a fall from a rock, while seeking for crystals;
and that he had dislocated his ankle, which had
caused him much pain. I was treated with the
greatest kindness by my old friends, and the remedies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
which the old dame applied to my aching sides, together
with the abundant food which I now enjoyed,
soon restored my good looks; but alas! I was destined
to suffer new misfortunes; for Simon, furious at my
having escaped his power, and thinking I might have
returned to my old master, came in search of me.
Unluckily, he arrived one morning when I was playing
before the door in the sun. It was now winter;
the snow was thick upon the hills, and the ponds
and rivers were covered with ice; you will wonder
that I should have been playing out of doors instead
of sleeping as is usual with the Marmottes in winter;
but when well fed and kept warm, this sleepiness
does not affect us. As I before said, I was outside
the door, and a short distance from the cottage, when
Simon arrived, and gently advancing towards me
with a piece of cake in his hand, persuaded me foolishly
to go quite close to him. Oh! how silly I was
to trust myself so near this wicked boy who had before
treated me so ill! But I never imagined he could intend
to hurt me, till I discovered myself once more in
his cruel hands; I then began to tremble, but it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
too late, for I was in his power, and there was no
way of escaping. I whistled as loud as I could, in
the hope of attracting the attention of little Jos&eacute;, but
he was still so lame that I might have been killed
before he could have arrived. Conceive then my
horror on finding myself carried away towards a
great pond at a short distance from the cottage. I
gave myself up for lost, when I saw the malicious
grin with which Simon looked at me; and my
fears were but too truly verified, for on approaching
the pond, he made a little hole in the ice, which was
very thick, and notwithstanding all my efforts to the
contrary, pushed me into it, and would, I doubt not,
have kept me there till I should have died of cold and
suffocation, had it not been for the lucky arrival of
my friend Jos&eacute;, who, attracted by my cries, had followed
us as fast as his ankle would allow him, and
came just in time to save me from instant death.</p>

<p>How is it possible that little boys and girls can
reconcile themselves to the idea of willingly inflicting
pain on poor unoffending animals committed to their
care, and formed for their benefit; but alas! it is, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
fear, too often the case; children are sometimes so very
naughty; but hoping my little readers possess kind
dispositions and feeling hearts, which would shudder
at the idea of giving pain to a poor dumb animal, I
will leave this disagreeable subject, and continue my
own melancholy story. On seeing Jos&eacute; approach,
Simon dragged me out of the water, and throwing me
half dead on the ground, ran away as fast as possible,
knowing, I suppose, that he had been very wicked,
and no doubt fearing to be punished for it by my little
protector, who was older and much stronger than
him. I now lost all power of seeing or hearing, and
laid for several days in a deep sleep. Jos&eacute; feared
very much I should die: he watched over me with
the greatest anxiety and kindness, for he was really
very fond of me; and when at length I recovered
sufficiently to open my eyes, his joy knew no bounds;
he sung, whistled, clapped his hands, and jumped and
danced with delight. (for his ankle had quite recovered
during my illness) He fetched me some bread and
milk, which by his entreaties I was at length induced
to eat; and it did me a great deal of good, for I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
soon able to move about; and being kept in the warm
kitchen by the fire side, was quite recovered before
spring arrived, with its delightful warm sun, which
made me gayer and merrier than ever.</p>

<p>The cruel Simon was shunned by all the village;
for no good little child would play with him after he
had behaved so wickedly to a poor animal which
could not defend itself.</p>

<p>One day, while at Aosta, a pretty town seated at
the foot of the Alps, on the river Dora, capital of the
valley of the same name, whither I had accompanied
my Master on a visit to his friends, as I was sitting
outside the window, waiting the return of Jos&eacute;, who
had gone on a message, my attention was attracted
by an ugly sallow-looking boy, who spoke so strange
a language, I could not at all understand him: induced
by my curiosity, which is a most shocking propensity
in little boys and girls, as well as in animals, I went
close to him, hoping to discover what he was saying.
He looked at me very earnestly, and I foolishly
imagined he admired my beauty. I think I hear
you say, &#8220;How could so ugly an animal as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Marmotte, think itself handsome?&#8221; but my dear little
friends you will, I fear, often meet with examples of
this kind of folly.</p>

<p>Not in the least fearing his approach, I allowed
him to stroke my head and smooth down my hair;
when, Oh! dreadful misfortune! he seized me in his
great hands, and, before I well knew what had happened,
I found myself in a large bag, hanging from
his back.</p>

<p>The unfeeling monster, regardless of my cries and
efforts to escape, whistled a gay tune, and continued
his road down one street and up another, till I was
quite tired; at length we stopped at a house; (so at
least I supposed, for I could not see any thing out of
the bag in which I was inclosed,) but instead of going
up stairs, we descended flight after flight, until we
arrived in a dark damp-looking room, which I afterwards
discovered to be a cellar. I was released from
my prison and placed on the floor, which was covered
with hare and rabbit skins, bird cages, boxes, and
rubbish of every description. Oh! how bitterly did
I now regret that idle curiosity which had led me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
approach this stranger, who had perhaps separated
me for ever from my dear little Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>I felt sure I should die if left long in this horrible
place, where the cold and disagreeable smell of the
hare and rabbit skins made me feel quite ill: I crept
into the corner the farthest from them, but here again
a new and still more dangerous object presented itself
in the form of a large dog lying fast asleep.</p>

<p>We Marmottes have as great an antipathy to
dogs as cats have; judge then of my horror on seeing
this one, which I doubted not would attack me as
soon as I should be perceived. I gave myself up for
lost, for it was so much larger and stronger than I
was, that I should have had no chance had we come
to blows; therefore, curling myself up into a ball, I
took refuge behind a great barrel, and now anxiously
desired the presence of the ugly sallow-faced boy,
whose departure had given me so much pleasure a few
minutes before; but it was a long long time before he
returned: however the great dog did not awake, and
I was delighted when the boy took me in his arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and carried me out of this horrible dungeon, which I
hoped most earnestly never again to enter.</p>

<p>What pleasure did I feel in again enjoying the
bright light of the sun, hoping, if once able to effect
my liberty, to discover Jos&eacute;, who I had not for an
instant ceased to think of; but I forgot the streets at
Aosta were more numerous, and not so well known
to me, as those of Courmayeur: however I had no
opportunity of trying my sagacity, for on being taken
up into the kitchen, I was given to a little boy who
was going to Paris to seek his fortune, as many little
boys from this country do.</p>

<p>My present owner told him to take me and sell
me for the highest price he could get. Though delighted
to escape from the miserable cellar where
I had been confined, still I could not endure the idea
of quitting my own country, and perhaps never again
seeing dear Jos&eacute;; I wept, screamed, whistled, and
bit, but all to no purpose. The journey to Paris was
very long and uninteresting, to me at least, who
could see nothing, travelling in a covered basket;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and as I am sure my little readers are impatient to
arrive at a large town, I will take them immediately
to Paris; that great and wonderful city, where there
are always so many amusing things to be seen.</p>

<p>I had every opportunity of enjoying all the novelties
and curiosities which the Champs Elys&eacute;es, the Boulevards,
and the streets present to a stranger; for the
little Swiss, who had brought me over, treated me
very kindly, and used to lead me all about with a
little red collar round my neck, from which was
suspended a long chain that fastened round his arm.</p>

<p>What amused me most of all the wonderful things
which I saw, was an exhibition called Punch. Those
of my little friends who have never seen it, will, I am
sure, be highly delighted when they have the good
fortune to make the acquaintance of this amiable
gentleman, who gives his life and adventures in a
most spirited manner, under the form of a delightful
little moveable theatre, of which he is the principal
actor.</p>

<p>We arrived just in time to see the carnival; a f&ecirc;te
at which people of all ages amuse themselves by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
dressing in different ridiculous costumes, as my little
friends I dare say often do, and parading the streets
and public walks, some in carriages, some on horseback,
and some on foot.</p>

<p>While accompanying my Master to the Boulevards,
where the best masks (for so they call these ridiculous
figures) are to be seen, I was&mdash;must I own it, naughty
enough to be highly amused by a misfortune which
happened to a poor little girl while crossing one of
the gutters which run through the middle of the
streets in Paris; she was very smartly dressed, in a
pink muslin frock, yellow handkerchief, blue bonnet,
and bright scarlet shoes, which were so tight for her,
she could hardly walk, but went rolling from one side
to another. When she arrived at the gutter, unable
to jump across from the pain which these tight shoes
made her suffer, her foot slipped, and she tumbled in.
Poor little girl; though I could not help laughing at
this misfortune, still I pitied her; for perhaps, after
all, it was not her fault that she wore such tight
shoes and was so oddly dressed.</p>

<p>On the Boulevards we saw a number of very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
curious figures, some dressed as harlequins, and others
as columbines, &amp;c. &amp;c. But there was one which
greatly astonished and amused me; it was a beautiful
monkey, much larger than any I had ever before
seen, mounted on a little pony which it trotted up and
down, looking as it passed into all the carriages,
through a large spy glass, at the same time making
the most hideous grimaces, and using its tail instead
of a whip to hurry its pony on. Judge of my surprise,
when I heard an old woman near me explaining
to a little girl, who was rather alarmed by the
near approach of this animal, that it was not really
a monkey, but a man dressed up as one! I could
hardly believe her, but I suppose it was true.</p>

<p>My attention was soon attracted by a pretty looking
girl, riding, not as I had always seen people ride, but
with her face towards the horse&#8217;s tail. I was very
much shocked, for I fancied it must be some naughty
child, placed there as a punishment; and soon after
meeting two or three more riding in the same manner,
I thought they must be school girls, who, having all
committed the same offence, had therefore received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the same punishment; but I afterwards discovered
they were not girls, but a set of little boys dressed up
in girls&#8217; clothes, and that they rode so for their own
amusement.</p>

<p>I was very fond of walking up and down the
Champs Elys&eacute;es in an evening, when it was crowded
with gay company, there were always so many things
to see; and I was so delighted with the attentions
paid me by the dear children who used to be running
about, with cheerful happy faces and merry laughter.</p>

<p>We one day took a ride in a ship,&mdash;&#8220;A ride!&#8221; I
think I hear you say, &#8220;how could that be?&#8221; but
such was the case, for we had neither sails nor water
to sail upon, but were in a kind of seat called, from
its shape, a vessel, which went round and round so
fast that I became quite giddy. As I was exhibiting
my tricks to three or four smiling children, an old
English lord, attracted by my cleverness, asked the
little boy if he would sell me; and I was much distressed
to hear him answer that he would willingly,
if he could get enough for me. &#8220;And what do you
call enough?&#8221; said the Englishman, &#8220;if I were to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
give you a napoleon, (a piece of French money, which
is not worth quite seventeen shillings) would you be
satisfied?&#8221; &#8220;Oh dear yes, and it is much more than
I ever expected to get for this poor little animal,&#8221; presenting
me to the old Lord, who told the boy to take me
to number &mdash; Rue St. Honore. He accordingly carried
me there in great glee, but was, I think, like
myself, rather sorry when he wished me good bye.
I was very much astonished at the magnificence of
the house where I now was; but what surprised me
most was, on entering the drawing-room after the old
gentleman&#8217;s return, to see what I supposed to be three
or four other Marmottes; when <i>I</i> moved they moved,
when <i>I</i> stood still they did so also: delighted to find
some animals like myself, I ran scampering up to
one of them, when, instead of finding a little Marmotte,
I hit my head against something very hard,
reeled, and fell back: on getting up, however, I still
saw the same objects, and was again advancing towards
one of them, when the old Lord taking me in
his arms, carried me to what I have since discovered
to be a large mirror, when I perceived, that what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
had taken for another Marmotte, was only the reflection
of myself. But I had no time to think how
very odd this was, (though I wished very much to
have sent a looking-glass to my father and mother,
as I am quite sure they never saw one) for the old
gentleman&#8217;s little grandson came running in, and
seizing me in his arms, scampered away to shew me
to his sister; and I really thought they would have
pulled me in pieces, for both insisted upon having me
to play with: however this sport was put an end to
by the arrival of a funny-looking old gentleman, with
a white head, who I soon found was a dancing-master;
and my little readers cannot think how
delighted I was when these young people began to
dance, to the sound of a beautiful instrument called a
kit, (not a kitten) which made the most charming
noise I ever heard. The little girl began by making
a low curtsy, and the little boy a bow; then off they
set, and seemed to me to be trying which could jump
highest. I forgot my miseries; and Jos&eacute; having taught
me to jump also, I ran into the middle of the room
and capered and frisked about in the highest glee;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the children clapping their hands and screaming
with delight, whilst the old gentleman could hardly
go on with the tune for laughing; till at last he could
resist it no longer, and began to jump as high as any
of us. We were all frisking about when the door
opened, and the old Lord entered: he laughed heartily
at the fun, and at last consented to be of the party,
to please his darling grandchildren. At first he was,
I confess, rather stiff; but this soon wore off, and he
capered better than any of us, making a charming
noise with his fingers; but at last when he was
taking an immense jump into the air, his large wig
fell off, and I being just where it came, received it on
my back! I really thought the little party would
have died with laughing at seeing me scampering
round the room with this large white wig on, like a
cloak, shaking a cloud of dust from it (called powder)
at every jump I took: though I was nearly blinded by
it, and I confess terribly frightened at first, yet when
I found it would not hurt me, I did not so much mind.
However standing still at last, the children took me
up in their arms, saying I was the most delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
animal they had ever seen; far more amusing than
Jacko, the monkey. Their grandpapa procured another
wig, and then they all went to dinner, when I
was greatly charmed at the beautiful dress of the two
servants, who had on coats of red cloth, with a great
quantity of gold lace upon them. I thought this Lord
must be a very rich man to put his gold upon his servants&#8217;
coats, instead of putting it into his pocket; and
if I could have spoken, I should have asked him to give
me a little to send to Jos&eacute; and his mother. As a
reward for my dancing, the children said I should
have a large apple all to myself; and you cannot
think my dear little friends howl liked it,&mdash;but, Oh!
I thought I should have died with fright when the
door opened and in came a large dog with Jacko, the
monkey, riding on his back. The moment he saw
me he jumped on the ground, chattering in the most
frightful manner, and grinning so as to shew all his
teeth. He came fiercely up to where I was eating
my apple, and before I knew what he was going to
do, snatched it from me: the footman seeing this,
came to take it away, but Mr. Jacko, knowing he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
had done wrong, was too clever for him, and throwing
the apple at the man&#8217;s head, hopped upon the
table, and in a violent rage (seeing the grandpapa
going to take hold of him) took up an orange in
each paw, and threw them at the old gentleman. A
violent uproar ensued, every body trying to catch the
enraged monkey, who screamed and chattered in the
most violent manner: cakes, oranges, apples, raisins,
plums, figs, in short every fruit upon the table, was
flying in the air, as the mischievous animal seized
them in his paws, and threw them about in all directions.
He had just got a plate in one paw, and a
bottle of wine in the other, which he intended to send
at the head of the old Lord, when fortunately one of
the footmen, seeing the case was desperate, took a
cushion from the sofa, with which he succeeded in
knocking Mr. Jacko down. The man was desired
to take him away and give him a good whipping, but
it did him no good; for a day or two afterwards we
were left in the drawing-room alone, and Mr. Jacko
no sooner heard the door shut than he jumped up from
his basket, where it was supposed he was fast asleep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
and looked round the room to see what mischief he
could be at. He first leaped upon a table where there
were some beautiful prints, and unfortunately there
was also an inkstand: well, Jacko peeped into this,
and thinking, I suppose, what it contained would be
good to drink, took hold of it in his paw and put it to
his mouth, but spit it all out again a great deal faster
than he had swallowed it. In a violent passion he
threw the inkstand down upon the table, and the ink
poured all over the beautiful prints. He then saw a
large china vase full of lovely flowers, and instantly
went to take one out, to smell I suppose, but it not
coming as easily as he wished, he gave a violent pull,
and down went the beautiful vase, which was broke
in a thousand pieces. Seeing all this mischief, I
thought I would try and make somebody hear, so I
whistled as loud as I could, for which I was rewarded
by his throwing a book at me with such force
that it knocked me down; after this, the ticking of
a clock caught his attention, and hopping on to the
table where it stood, he tapped at the glass which
covered it, very gently at first, but at last in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
a rage that it broke! But this time he was punished,
for the broken glass cut his foot, and, screaming with
pain, he ran about the room spoiling every thing he
touched with his bleeding paw: at last he saw the
little girl&#8217;s basket lying on a chair, and going up to it,
thinking I suppose there was something inside which
he wished to eat, gently put his paw in: at first he
did not venture to poke it low enough to get whatever
it was that he wanted, but being too impatient to give
up the attempt, he stuffed his head in so fast, that
he remained with the basket sticking on it like a hat,
so far over his eyes that he could not see. I never
saw such a rage as he was in; he ran about the room
thumping against all the chairs and tables, and must
have hurt himself very much: however a servant
coming in caught hold of Mr. Jacko, and carried him
away to chain him up. The old Lord was so angry
when he saw the mischief he had done, that he gave
him away directly. I liked my little Masters exceedingly;
for though they did pull me about, yet they
never hurt me.</p>

<p>Soon after these events we all left Paris for England;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
in a great machine on four wheels, called &#8220;The
Family Coach.&#8221; I travelled inside on little Lucy&#8217;s
knee, and slept nearly all the way. How astonished
I was on opening my eyes, after a long nap, to see at
Boulogne an enormous quantity of water all collected
together, so much, that I could not perceive any land,
but beautiful blue waves for miles and miles. Whilst
changing horses, we walked down to the sands, and
saw some little boats come in, full of different sorts of
fish, which their owners had caught in the sea, for
that is what they call the great body of water which
so much astonished me. I thought it very cruel to
kill all those pretty fish, which must have feelings
like myself; but they told me that almost all the poor
people there lived upon them.</p>

<p>We arrived at Calais late in the evening, and set
off next morning by break of day in a large vessel
called a &#8220;Steam Boat:&#8221; not feeling any ill effects
from its motion, I was greatly amused by watching
all the strange people on board. There was one, a
Miss Wilnemina Pugabunder, who seemed to cause
infinite entertainment to all the passengers, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
ridiculous affection she shewed for her numerous pets.
A little French Poodle, with a silver collar, ornamented
with small bells, and a long blue riband; a large
Angola Cat, with a gilt collar, on which were engraved
its own name of &#8220;Silver Tabby,&#8221; and that of
its mistress; a large Macaw, two or three guinea-pigs,
shut up in a basket, and a quantity of gold and
silver fish, in a large tub of fresh water. Though so
ill that she was almost unable to stand, still she would
not leave her favourites, but staid coaxing first one
and then the other, and doing her best to keep peace
between them; for the dog did not like the parrot,
and the cat seemed to have rather too great an affection
for the fish; and when they unluckily came in contact
with each other, there was such a screaming
from the animals themselves, as well as their mistress,
that you would have thought there was a whole
menagerie on board. Another of the passengers, an
old lady, was so fat, and such an enormous size, that
it seemed quite a trouble to her to move about; but
her husband was quite the contrary, which rendered
her the more remarkable. I at first took him for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
her son, and it was not till I heard her call him
husband, that I could believe it, for he was not, I am
sure, so tall as my little Master, C&aelig;sar. I afterwards
learned they called him a dwarf, and that he was
going to England to show himself as a curiosity, as
well as his wife, whose extraordinary rotundity
rendered her a still greater object of astonishment.</p>

<p>We did not go to London on our road to Cherry
Tree Park, the seat of the Old Lord; at which I was
very sorry, but comforted myself with the hope of
visiting it at some future time. All I saw in this
new country surprised me greatly; every thing was
so different from what I had before seen. I longed
for poor Jos&eacute; to share in the kindness and attentions
I received from this good family. The Young Lord
(as my little Master C&aelig;sar was called, to distinguish
him from his grandfather) was a good tempered, high
spirited lad, and though he did sometimes tease me by
making me run more than I liked, still I was very
fond of him, for I knew he did not do it with a wish
to torment me. His little sister Lucy was very amiable;
all the poor about her Grandfather&#8217;s estate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
seemed quite to adore her, she was so good to them,
and spent all her money in buying them clothes,
which she made herself. I advise all my little friends
who have it in their power, to be charitable; for, from
the pleasure this little girl seemed to enjoy when
making others happy, it must be a very delightful
thing.</p>

<p>Never having lived a country life, except in my
native village, I was greatly surprised at all the
wonderful things I saw at the farm: the nice clean
kitchen, with its sanded floor, bright oven, great arm
chair, and large wooden clock, delighted me excessively;
but I was still more pleased when I saw how
kind and attentive they are to animals in England:
the fold, with its fat beasts; the piggery, with its great
engine, to dress the dinners of its sleepy inhabitants;
the hen houses, with their flews, to keep them warm
in winter; the cow-house, so clean and neat, were
all new to me: but I must not omit the dairy, where
I was a constant visiter when I could escape unobserved,
and steal from its bright earthen vases the
good new milk, or fine rich cream. When, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
I was discovered to have committed this offence, I
was always severely punished, and told it was very
wicked to steal, even a thing of hardly any value;
for if you can see no harm in taking a cake or a bit
of sugar which does not belong to you, you will soon
think there can be no harm in taking a sixpence or
shilling from Papa or Mamma, if you want it.</p>

<p>I here saw what I had been before told of,&mdash;shearing
sheep. Little C&aelig;sar took me down with him
one morning to the small stream which runs close to
the farm, where they were washing the whole flock,
previous to depriving them of their nice wool. I
was almost stunned with the noise of the men and
boys, the barking of the dogs, and the bleating of the
poor animals themselves, who did not seem at all to
like this cold bath, and gained the opposite bank as
fast as possible. A few days after, while their wool
was yet of a snowy white, the shepherd drove them
from the nice green hill where they were feeding to
the farm, where, fastened in the sheep pen, each waited
its turn to be committed to the hands of the shearer.</p>

<p>Little Lucy and her brother were very fond of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
riding: they had two beautiful ponies which their
Grandpapa had given them. C&aelig;sar&#8217;s was a very great
favourite; it was so small, that one day having gone
out to meet the hounds, which were running in the
fields near the house, its long bushy tail, which nearly
touched the ground, was by them taken for the fox&#8217;s
brush, and they all ran after him for some distance.
C&aelig;sar was greatly amused at this little adventure,
and came home in high glee to relate to his sister the
ludicrous mistake of the hounds in taking poor Taffey
for a fox. This pony was very fond of apples, and
when his little master did not take him one, would
snuff about and put his nose into his pocket, to see if
he had forgot to bring him one, or was only withholding
it for his own amusement. When Taffey was
turned out in an evening, the children used to go and
play with him in the field; he knew their voices so
well that he came trotting up as soon as ever they
called him; sometimes they gave him a pocket handkerchief,
which he would take in his mouth, gallop all
round the field with, and bring back, without having
in the least injured it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>The harvest-home was a scene of great mirth and
gaiety: my little friends were permitted to join the
merry group, who, after the happy termination of
their labours, had a feast and dance in the verdant
meadow their hands had helped to mow. The Old
Lord seemed greatly pleased with the amusement of
his labourers and workmen.</p>

<p>On Little C&aelig;sar&#8217;s birthday, which was the 17th of
June, he was allowed to invite a large party of his
young friends to come and spend the day with him
and his sister. They had a great deal of fun;
donkey races for little books and toys, foot races, and
games of every sort, from puss in the corner to hunt
the slipper: the evening ended with a sillabub under
a spreading beech tree; and great was the anxiety to
find to whose share the ring and sixpence would fall.
Little Lucy drew the ring, and Alfred Talbot, a friend
of C&aelig;sar, got the sixpence, upon which there was
a great noise, and all the children laughed excessively
at the little boy; why, I could not imagine.</p>

<p>I was very unhappy to hear the Old Lord say, one
day to his grandchildren, &#8220;My dears you are now old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
enough for me to think of sending you to school.
Your poor father had such an affection for public
education, that I agreed to his dying request of your
receiving one, when of proper age.&#8221; The little
children both looked very grave at this address, and
the tears starting into poor Lucy&#8217;s eyes, she had some
trouble to hide her grief from her affectionate protector,
who could never bear to see her afflicted.</p>

<p>But I am sure she could not have been more grieved
than I was; the idea that I should probably be separated
from my dear little friends, and perhaps fall into
the hands of some wicked boy, careless little girl, or
cross old gentleman, who, if I only discovered he wore
a wig, would, unlike my good Old Lord, be furious
instead of amused; or some old grumpy woman, who
would prefer her tabbies, her minettes, her pugs and
her poodles to me, and would scold me most severely
for every slight misdemeanour. This idea made me
very melancholy; and the evening after I had heard
this distressing intelligence I could eat no supper,
and retired for the night with a wretched head-ache,
feeling very ill. I was awoke next morning by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
C&aelig;sar and Lucy who were talking very earnestly.
&#8220;But,&#8221; said the little boy, &#8220;I do not see why I should
be so sorry to go to school: it must be very nice to
have so many companions of my own age.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
replied his sister, &#8220;but you will be so far from home!
so far from dear Grandpapa!&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;But I shall always
come home for the holidays, and I shall have such
long accounts to give you, dear Lucy, of all I have
seen and heard&mdash;Oh! it will be very nice! and our
holiday will, I hope, be at the same time.&#8221; &#8220;How
can you think you will like going to school,&#8221; asked
Lucy, &#8220;where you will have to get up so early, to
work so hard, and to eat a great piece of thick batter
pudding before you begin your dinner, that you may
not devour too much meat?&#8221; &#8220;That is the account
Willy Dawson gives of his school,&#8221; replied C&aelig;sar;
&#8220;but if you ask Tommy Longshanks, he is always
sorry when it is holiday time; for at Mr. Thumpem&#8217;s
they are so happy and merry, playing at cricket, football,
leap frog, battledoor and shuttlecock, fishing, and
shooting with a bow and arrow, as soon as lessons are
over,&mdash;Oh! I think it will be quite delightful!&#8221; &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
wish I could expect as much amusement at the school
I am going to,&#8221; observed Lucy; &#8220;but I fear the girls,
like those at Mrs. Adagio&#8217;s, will be very sentimental,
and pass their time on a verdant lawn, at the edge of
a running brook, or under the branches of a weeping
willow, scribbling poetry, or at least attempting to do
so.&#8221; &#8220;Well we shall see,&#8221; said C&aelig;sar; &#8220;but come
to Mrs. Marmalade&#8217;s, she promised to make each of
us a large plum cake whenever we went to school, so
we must remind her of it.&#8221; So saying they left the
room, and I saw no more of them until breakfast time,
when Little Lucy, bringing me some bread and milk,
said very sorrowfully, &#8220;My poor dear Little Marmotte,
what will become of you when we are gone.&#8221; Oh!
how I longed to speak her language, to have asked
her more about her departure! In the middle of the
day, while I was sitting in the drawing-room with
the Old Lord, who on account of the heat had taken
off his wig and thrown it down, the entrance bell
rung, and, in a minute, before he could find his wig
or make his escape from the room, a servant announced
Mrs. Eliza Grey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>&#8220;My dear Mrs. Grey, I am greatly shocked that
I have lost my wig!&#8221; exclaimed the old gentleman,
as he advanced towards his visiter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost it! Has my naughty Little Lucy been playing
you some new trick,&mdash;teasing Grandpapa as
usual?&#8221; &#8220;No, indeed I have not,&#8221; said my young
mistress, who had overheard these words as she tripped
gaily into the room, &#8220;but dear grannie! how
very funny you look with your bald head!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think your naughty little pet must have stolen
my periwig, as you always call it, for I can find it
nowhere.&#8221; &#8220;What is this new pet of yours, my
dear Lucy?&#8221; inquired Mrs. Grey, &#8220;I think I have
never seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not seen my Marmotte!&#8221; exclaimed she, running
across the room to the corner, where, reclining on the
very wig in question, I was enjoying the ludicrous
appearance of my old friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you abominable little thief!&#8221; cried Lucy,
as soon as she perceived me. &#8220;What have you done?
I pity you the scolding you will get,&#8221; added she,
laughingly restoring the wig to her Grandfather, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
placing me on Mrs. Grey&#8217;s knee. &#8220;And what are
you going to do with this poor little animal, when
you go to school?&#8221; said this good old Lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, and I am very unhappy about it;
but come Marmi, show some of your tricks to this
good Lady.&#8221; Upon which, I jumped down, and
began to dance and caper about to her great amusement;
she seemed highly delighted to see me eat like
a squirrel&mdash;sitting on my hind feet and feeding myself
with my front paws.</p>

<p>To Lucy&#8217;s infinite delight, and my no small pleasure,
Mrs. Grey proposed taking me home with her; she
had such a kind benevolent countenance, and such
good natured affectionate manners, that I was sure
she must be very amiable, and therefore liked the idea
of living with her, better than the chance of falling
into the hands of some one who might not treat me
so well. It was not, however, without a deep feeling
of regret, that I took leave of the Old Lord and his
charming grandchildren, and quitted Cherry Tree
Park; for though I was sure Mrs. Grey would treat
me very kindly, yet not being acquainted with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
household, I feared there might be people under her
hospitable roof, who might not treat me so well; and so
it proved, for Miss Stitcher, the lady&#8217;s maid, looked at
me as an intruder, and was very cross from the first
day of my arrival; and the dreadful quarrels there
sometimes were between her favourite lap dog and myself,
only served to increase her ill will towards me;
but Mrs. Grey continued very kind, and I heard her
one day saying, &#8220;It is very wrong of you, Martha,
to treat that poor little animal so ill; I always see
you pinching and kicking it, whenever it comes near
you.&#8221; Miss Stitcher did not answer, but turned
away looking very ill-natured.</p>

<p>A short time after this, we went to London to pass
a few days. I expected great amusement from all
the pretty things there, and hoped perhaps to see my
dear little Lucy, whose school was in that vast city.
But, as it happened, I was never more to see her;
for the morning after our arrival, I was sitting at the
open window of the first floor apartment, when a
boy with a barrel organ stopped before the house
where we were, and played the national air of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
country, which poor Jos&eacute; used so often to whistle: I
listened, I gazed at the boy, I listened again, and
then having assured myself, by a long and ardent
look, of the identity of this little musician, with my
oldest and best friend Jos&eacute;, I sprang from the window
and leaped into his arms. He had also, I think,
recognized me; for I had a white mark under my
chin, which is not usual in animals of my species.
He caressed me, and called me his dear Pierrot;
and seeing I answered to this name, he was confident
I was his own little Marmotte; and on Mrs. Grey&#8217;s
coming to the window to see what had become of
me, he related to her my former history, and the
manner in which he had lost me.</p>

<p>This good old lady, touched by the affection which
he shewed for me, and which I seemed to return
with such pleasure and gratitude, consented to give
me up to my former possessor; and the guinea which
she kindly added to the little sum he had collected
during his absence from his native country, enabled
him to return to his own village, and poor old mother,
accompanied by me, whose joy at once more visiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the rugged Alps and fertile valley d&#8217;Aosta, in company
with my dear Jos&eacute;, knew no bounds; but I
was very sorry on arriving at his cottage to perceive
how much his mother was changed during my absence.
Poor old woman; she now hobbles about
with a great stick to support her tottering steps, and
age will, I fear, soon deprive her of her sight, which
is already become very dim.</p>

<p>The meeting between the mother and son was
quite affecting. Jos&eacute; was now looked upon as the
village oracle, having seen so much more of the world
than even its oldest inhabitants. His opinion was
consulted, and his advice was taken upon every occasion.
I was also treated with greater respect for
being a traveller; and I can assure you I did look very
grave and learned, when seated on the bench by the
side of Jos&eacute;: I listened to the long accounts he gave
of all he had seen and heard; and it was the amusement
which these relations seemed to give his companions
that first gave me the idea of placing my
adventures on paper for the amusement of my young
friends, the Young Lord and his sister Lucy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>If any of my little readers desire to know the fate
of the wicked Simon, who bore so conspicuous a part
in the commencement of this story, I will inform them,
that notwithstanding the beatings and lectures he received
from his father, as well as the fear and dislike
shewed him by all the villagers, he continued his inhuman
conduct, and at last fell a victim to it. May
his fate prove a warning to all those who are disposed
to behave cruelly and wickedly towards poor feeble
animals, who have not force or strength to defend
themselves. Let them remember that holy precept
&#8220;do unto others as thou wouldest that they should
do unto thee;&#8221; and ask themselves whether they
would like to be as ill used as the miserable victims
of their power.</p>

<p>One day, a few months after I had quitted the
valley, Simon went out accompanied by two large
dogs, to amuse himself with chasing some cattle
which were grazing in the valley. These animals,
rendered furious by this violent exercise, and the
wounds inflicted by the teeth of the dogs which
Simon barbarously urged on to attack them, turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
fiercely upon their savage enemy, and knocking him
down, soon left him a bloody and mangled corpse;
a frightful example of what the free indulgence of
the passions generally leads to.</p>

<p>I am writing in the chimney corner of Jos&eacute;&#8217;s
kitchen, which I hope never again to quit for any
length of time. I am as happy here as I can be:
my only complaint is that the day is never half long
enough; and I do not think I should ever have found
time to write this little book, had I not heard of the
dreadful misery existing in Ireland, and determined,
if possible, to add my mite to the generous contributions
of the benevolent. My success now remains
with you, my dear friends; and pray remember,
while you read these few pages, that it is a Marmotte
who writes, in the hope of providing a morsel of food
for your poor starving fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>I must now forward this little work to Mrs. Eliza
Grey, who has kindly offered to translate it; and
only hope it may not arrive too late to aid in buying
some potatoes.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
